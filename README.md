Analytics Cautions - Biased training data is a huge (ahem, yuge) problem for machine-learning. Cities that use data from racist frisking practices to determine who the police should stop end up producing algorithmic racism; court systems that use racist sentencing records to train a model that makes sentencing recommendations get algorithmic racism, too.

## About Data, Data Measurement Concepts, Spreadsheet Analytics

“garbage in produces garbage out.”

Mark Twain popularized the saying, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” It is true that data are frequently used selectively to give arguments a false sense of support. Knowingly misusing data or concealing important information about the way data and data summaries have been obtained is, of course, highly unethical. 


For example, Google Flu Trends debuted to great excitement in 2008, but turned out to overestimate the prevalence of influenza by nearly 50%, largely due to bias caused by the way the data were collected; see Harford [8], for example.

## Descriptive Statistics
Statistical Methods Should Enable Data to Answer Scientific Questions

This shift in perspective from statistical technique to scientific question may change the way one approaches data collection and analysis. 

After learning about the questions, statistical experts discuss with their scientific collaborators the ways that data might answer these questions and, thus, what kinds of studies might be most useful.

## Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

## Sampling and Estimation

## Statistical Inference, A/B Testing

“Treat statistics as a science, not a recipe.” This is a great candidate for Rule 0.

## Trend Analysis, Regression
"Typically, a subject matter expert and a data scientist construct regression models to look at the relationships between independent variables that drive future events. They have a hypothesis that guides the analysis [so] they come up with relatively predictable outcomes. Machine learning picks up unexpected relationships," said Larry Schor, SVP at population health management solution provider Medecision, in an interview.

Rationale for Correct Answers 
23.	d) Information architecture CORRECT: Information architecture refers to the analysis and design
of the data stored by information systems, concentrating on entities, their attributes, and their interrelationships. It refers to the modeling of data for an individual database and to the corporate data models that an enterprise uses to coordinate the de nition of data in several (perhaps scores or hundreds) distinct databases. 

24.	a) have negligible impact upon the adjusted R-squared. CORRECT: The increase in size of the data will not impact the adjusted R-squared calculation because both samples are suf ciently large randomly selected subsets of data. 

25.	b) Logistic regression CORRECT: This type of classi cation model is often used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable (response vs. no response) based on one or more predictor variables, so this is the most appropriate answer. The goal of the analytics in the stated problem is to determine who is most likely to respond, and the binary nature of this predicted outcome is provided by logistic regression. 

26.	d) Mixed integer programming (MIP) CORRECT: This is a mathematical optimization technique used when one or more of the variables are restricted to be integers. It is an effective optimization model. 

27.	d) if the data is skewed and, if so, in which direction. CORRECT: A box and whisker plot, sometimes just called a “box plot,” was invented by John Tukey as a way to graphically display the distribution of data. The ends of the box are at the rst and third quartiles, and there is a line somewhere in the box representing the median value. The whiskers extend either to the minimum and maximum values in the data set, or possibly less if they do not include points identi ed as outliers. 

28.	c) Business issue and project goal CORRECT: Understanding the business issue and project goal provides a sound foundation on which to base the project. 

29.	c) Variability in arrival and service times will tend to play a critical role in congestion. CORRECT: Arrival and service time distributions are inputs to a queuing model that would be used to model a checkout line and directly in uence congestion. 

30.	a) Greater than $5000 CORRECT: If we consider the pro t from an individual vehicle to be the wholesale price minus the variable cost, we see that the pro t from a Gasoline Technology vehicle
is $25K-$15K = $10K. Similarly, the pro t from a “Green” Technology vehicle is $40K-$35K = $5K.
In order to make up for this difference in lost pro t, the subsidy provided to the automaker would have to be at least $5K (the difference between $10K and $5K). In addition, the subsidy would need to be greater than $5000 so that the automakers would be able to recover their increased xed costs at a reasonable level of demand. 

31.	a) Optimization CORRECT: The problem statement describes an optimization problem: the furniture maker’s objective function is to maximize his pro t. The decision variables are the amount of each item to produce, and the constraints are that he must meet demand and be within his budget. Optimization is the most appropriate technique to solve this problem. 

32.	b) present a histogram to show the distribution of various NPV estimates. CORRECT: Net Present Value (NPV) takes as input a time series of cash ow (both incoming and outgoing) and a discount 

rate and outputs a price. By showing a histogram (a graphical representation of the distribution of data), it is possible to see how likely various NPVs (beyond the given minimum and maximum) are to occur. This would be useful information to have when considering a decision, especially since the range of outcomes includes $0, meaning the decision could result in a pro t or a loss. 
33.	d) Discrete event simulation because there are a sequence of random events through time. CORRECT: The time to load shipments depends on the experience of the crew, products being shipped, and weather. Given that there is a sequence of random events through time, discrete event simulation is the most appropriate modeling approach. 

34.	c) Both investors are subject to the same uncertainty. CORRECT: Both investors are subject to the same uncertainty regarding the stock market. 

35.	a) Use 70,000 randomly selected data points when building the model, and hold the remaining 30,000 out as a test dataset. CORRECT: This split provides suf cient data to build the model and suf cient data to test the model. This is the best allocation of the customer data points, (A common ‘rule of thumb’ is to use about two thirds of the data to build the model and one third to test it.) 

36.	c) allow calculation of relative importance of varying features and attributes to customers. CORRECT: Conjoint analysis by de nition maps consumer preference structures into mathematical tradeoffs, and was designed to allow a marketer to compare the relative utility of varying features and attributes. 

37.	c) reveal interactions without having to explicitly build them into the model. CORRECT: Tree-based models and neural networks are employed to nd patterns in the data that were not previously identi ed (or input into the model building process). 

38.	d) P is less than $3,000,000. CORRECT: When the demand is 1000 or greater, the pro t is $3,000,000. But when the demand is less than 1000, the pro t is less than $3,000,000. Given this and that the average demand is 1000 units, the expected monthly pro t must be less than $3,000,000. 

39.	b) bias. CORRECT: The bias measures the difference, including the direction of the estimate and the right answer. Depending on whether it’s positive or negative, it will show whether there is an over or under estimate. 

40.	d) 7.0 CORRECT: To answer this question, one needs to solve the decision tree using the “roll back” technique. Continuing back the bottom branch of the tree, the expected time if you y is (0.5)(9.0) + (0.5)(5) = 7.0 hours. Now, when faced with the “drive or y” decision, you should choose to y (since 7.0 hours is less than 7.35 hours). Thus, answer d) 7.0 hours is the expected travel time of the optimal (or minimal travel time) decision. 

41.	b) Determine if there has been a change in model accuracy over time. CORRECT: The most important maintenance activity for the analytics professional responsible for maintaining the simulation model is to monitor the accuracy of the model over time. If there has been a change in accuracy, the analytics professional may need to revisit the assumptions of the model. 

42.	d) Clustering and decision trees CORRECT: Customer segmentation consists of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in speci c ways relevant to marketing, e.g., age, gender, interests, spending habits and so on. The purpose of customer segmentation is to allow a company to target speci c groups of customers effectively and allocate marketing resources to best effect. Two ways to do this segmentation are clustering and decision trees. 

43.	a) Strategy B exhibits stochastic (probabilistic) dominance over Strategy A. CORRECT: Because the cumulative probability curve for Strategy B is below (or to the right) of the corresponding curve for Strategy A, it can be said that Strategy B exhibits stochastic dominance (SD) over Strategy A. B stochastically dominates A when, for any good outcome x, B gives at least as high a probability of 

receiving at least x as does A, and for some x, B gives a higher probability of receiving at least x. Since the curves do not cross, B stochastically dominates A. 
44.	c) Remove opt-outs. CORRECT: The list of marketing leads should not include people or organizations that have opted out. 

45.	a) Collapse several survey questions regarding food taste, health value, ingredients, and consistency into one general unobserved "food quality" variable. CORRECT: Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. The information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. 

46.	b) multidimensional modeling. CORRECT: Multidimensional modeling is the optimum way to organize data in a data warehouse for analysis. It is associated with OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing). OLAP data is organized in cubes that can be taken directly from the data warehouse for analysis.
